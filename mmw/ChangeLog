ChangeLog for mmw

1.9 to 2.0
    Updated manual page
    Added a subdivision of 1/10 GB (not apparent to user) so ranges of 1-10
        GB still print in MB units.
    Changed usage over to an atomic printf
    Converted exits and returns to posix macro
    Fixed if no /proc/meminfo to exit with failure (before it did nothing)
    Moved the sleep interval to end of reading /proc/meminfo to mimic how
        other similar utils work
    Combined poll and sleep check into one shot deal

1.8 to 1.9
    Added human readable format flag.
    Made optargs required for interval and polls to cut down on confusion.
    Ripped out useless helper_*() code.
    Rewrote the options parser to use getoptlong.
    Added swap option
    All arguments now require an option; although the old format is still
    supported.

1.7 to 1.8
    Fixed a bug in the mem_array data set. If a variable does not exist in
    /proc/meminfo mmw was printing unitialized int data. Created a simple
    init loop for the structure to preset all data to 0.

1.6 to 1.7
    Short ifs
    Yet new contact info again

1.5 to 1.6
    Cleaned up some types
    New contact info

1.4 to 1.5
    setup helper, usage and error printing to have slightly
    improved reusability.

    altered several variable storage methods, there were groups
    of variables that are simply better served as arrays.

    created a single global const for default polls/intervals.

    removed polls/intervals variables from main and directly
    convert user input into intergers (just a time_saver really).

    found ANOTHER reference to meminfo int he man page - jeez!

    finally, variable field width format, mmw now supports up
    to 100TB Memory for monitoring, wahoo!

1.3 to 1.4
    installed GNU packaging

1.2 to 1.3
    More administrivia, memwathc was still lurking in
    the man page and lsm file

1.1 to 1.2
    Administrivia, I had memwatch as the program name
    in the source - oops
