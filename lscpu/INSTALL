Install File for lscpu

There are several install methods, you can use the standard:

	./configure
	make

	su to root and:

	make install

or if you are feeling lucky, skip the './configure' part and shoot straight to 
	make; make install

alternately you may keep the binary in a local directory, just be advised that
the uninstall rule will not work properly.
